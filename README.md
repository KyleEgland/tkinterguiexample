# Tkinter GUI Example

A Python application written with the tkinter library to provide a GUI for this example project.

## Synopsis

This is an "evergreen" learning project meant to demonstrate Python, the tkinter GUI library, and my own capabilities. This project started as something to tinker with in order to isolate project specific code from its interface representation in order experiment. I was having issues with implemenation of certain tasks and found it nice to have a "clean reference." The Tkinter GUI Example has, since its initial creation, has been subjected to refactoring in order to present better code and practices. My intention is not to "get it right" but to make it better so that others may learn from what is here. I've also learned new practices and design patterns as well that I'd like to replicate in past projects to have better references (and starting points - D.R.Y.) for the future.

## Getting started

View the documentation [here](https://kyleegland.info/tkinterguiexample).

This project utilizes a `requirements.txt` file to maintain its dependencies, however, it may be run without understanding what all that means - you simply need Python 3 installed on your machine and reachable from the system path. After cloning the project, navigate to the project directory and issue `python MyExampleApp`. This will run the project from the command line and provide debug logging output to the console.
